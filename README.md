This tool analyzes the core features of a pcap file, breaking down the overall trends into easily understandable, graphically displayed statistics. This tool displays information about IP addresses, protocols, and the geolocation of packets to give a more holistic understanding of the traffic. It utilizes traditional rule-based anomaly detection and Artificial Intelligence powered anomaly detectin to predict which packets contain potentially malicious activity by checking for suspicious activity within packets. After analyzing that, it uses this information to train the Decision Tree model to recognize malicious packets based on features it recognizes for better detection in future files uploaded.
